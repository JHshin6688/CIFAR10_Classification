# CIFAR10_Classification
In this project, I built a CNN model that classifies CIFAR10 dataset, using PyTorch.

I implemented a CNN layer using torch library and named it as 'My_Conv2D'.

Using a number of 'My_Conv2D' layers, maxpooling layers, and dropout layers, I built a CNN model and named it as 'MyOwnClassifier'.

The loss and accuracy for train data and test data are shown in the graph at the last part.
